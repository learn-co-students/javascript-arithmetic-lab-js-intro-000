# JavaScript Arithmetic Lab

## Objectives

- Practice doing math with JavaScript
- Practice writing functions that do things with numbers
- Practice parsing strings as numbers

## Introduction

In this lab, we're going to practice writing functions and manipulating numbers
in JavaScript. First, though, we need to go over some basic math. In this lab,
we're going to learn about various arithmetic operators. What's an operator, you
say? It's a symbol that _operates_ on one or more (usually two) objects â€” `+` is
a good example. The `+` operator says "add what's to the left of `+` and what's
to the right of `+` together."

As you read through this lesson, you're going to be adding your solutions to
`index.js`. You'll write a total of eight functions; use the results of running
`learn test` in your IDE to guide you towards the right function names and
functionality.

`makeInt(string)` should take in a string, parse it into an
base 10 integer and return it. `preserveDecimal(string)` should take in a string, parse it
into a float and return it.
